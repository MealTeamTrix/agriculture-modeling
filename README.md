# Crop Prediction using Soil Measurements

This project evaluates the predictive power of individual soil features (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, and pH) using Logistic Regression. The goal is to determine which soil feature best predicts crop type.

## Dataset

The dataset `soil_measures.csv` should contain:
- Features: `N`, `P`, `K`, `ph`
- Target: `crop` (categorical class representing the crop type)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
